# CSS Variable Background Image Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to using CSS variables with the `background-image` property and URLs. The issue arises when a CSS variable contains a `url()` function. The variable doesn't resolve properly, causing the background image not to render correctly. This is often unexpected behavior for developers using CSS variables.

## Problem

The `bug.css` file showcases the problem where the background image set using a CSS variable is not applied.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file provides a workaround.  The recommended solution is to avoid directly embedding the `url()` function inside the CSS variable and instead use the variable to store just the path and concatenate it within the `background-image` property. 

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your browser (you'll need to create a simple HTML file referencing bug.css).
3. Observe that the element with class `element` doesn't show the expected background image.
4. Now open `bugSolution.html` (create similarly) and compare to see the solution working.
