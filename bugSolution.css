To solve this issue, avoid embedding the `url()` function within the CSS variable. Instead, store the image path in the variable and construct the `url()` within the `background-image` property.

```css
:root {
  --bg-image-path: 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
}

.element {
  background-image: url(var(--bg-image-path));
}
```
This approach ensures the correct resolution of the CSS variable and the successful application of the background image.
