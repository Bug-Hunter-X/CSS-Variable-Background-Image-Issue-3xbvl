The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `background-image` property doesn't work as expected when used with a CSS variable containing a URL. 
```css
:root {
  --bg-image: url('https://example.com/image.jpg');
}

.element {
  background-image: var(--bg-image);
}
```
The `background-image` will not render correctly, while using the url directly works correctly.  This is because the `var()` function doesn't correctly handle the `url()` function within it.
